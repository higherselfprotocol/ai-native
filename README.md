ayni-ledger: benefit tracking with local, auditable entries.
offline-core: local runtime, storage, and Bluetooth/SMS mesh sync.
ui-local: low‑literacy and voice‑first interfaces (Spanish/Quechua).
Until then

No code is included.
Do not open PRs adding code. Use Issues for documentation feedback and ethics alignment only.
