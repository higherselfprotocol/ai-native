Architecture and code coming in Q1 2026, following formal co‑governance agreements with Chahuaytiri and prison partners.

Protocol Overview
Principles (Andean cosmology as requirements)

Yachay (Wisdom): Contextual, situated knowledge; explainable and accountable to place and language.
Llankay (Embodied Work): AI supports collective work; dignity of labor is non‑negotiable.
Munay (Heart): Relational care; refusal is a valid and often protective outcome.
Ayni (Reciprocity): Each authorized use returns tangible benefit defined locally.
Minka (Collective Work): Communities are co‑designers and decision‑makers.
Governance requirements

Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC): Explicit, revocable, multi‑level (individual, family, guild/ayllu, council).
Data sovereignty: Communities retain all rights to designs, stories, and knowledge; code is open, data is sovereign.
Offline‑first: No cloud dependency; local devices, Bluetooth/SMS mesh for minimal sync.
Non‑surveillance: No facial recognition, predictive policing, behavior/emotion inference, or covert tracking.
Benefit‑sharing: Commit at least 50% of research outputs in usable forms (training, devices, infrastructure, language resources).
Cultural IP layer: “Do Not Train/Do Not Generate” tags; sacred content is not digitized or is hard‑refused by policy.
Transparency and redress: Human‑readable logs, cryptographic checks, clear takedown and remediation paths.
Environmental care: Low‑power hardware, repairability, e‑waste plans.
Initial implementation pathways (proposed)

Chahuaytiri textile stewardship: Local archive with cultural consent and provenance ledger; Quechua/Spanish interfaces.
Prison wellbeing: Offline kiosks for self‑support and rights awareness; zero external data transfer; no risk scoring.
Boundaries

Non‑commercial; no monetization of community knowledge.
Contributions gated until cultural protocols and reciprocity agreements are in place.

Planned modules (subject to community approval)

consent-engine: explicit, revocable, multi‑level permissions with offline propagation.
policy-layer: enforcement of Non‑Surveillance Clause and Cultural IP tags (“Do Not Train/Generate”).
ayni-ledger: benefit tracking with local, auditable entries.
offline-core: local runtime, storage, and Bluetooth/SMS mesh sync.
ui-local: low‑literacy and voice‑first interfaces (Spanish/Quechua).
Until then

No code is included.
Do not open PRs adding code. Use Issues for documentation feedback and ethics alignment only.
